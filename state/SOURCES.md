# Sources — priority checklist

The PDFs in `sources/`, one row per numbered question, each mapped to a curriculum topic.

How this file sets the next topic and when a row is ticked is defined in `core/BOOTSTRAP.md`
(§3 *The next topic*, §5 *Close*). A new question goes in as a row with the topic it belongs to;
if no topic fits, add one to `core/CURRICULUM.md` first. The PDF answers are shallow definitions —
the lesson teaches the mechanism, the PDF supplies the question.
