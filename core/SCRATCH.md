# The scratch contract

A **scratch session** is a fast batch pass: several topics taught back to back, the important part
of each, one quiz at the end. It is an overview, not a lesson. For this session it replaces steps
1–5 of `core/METHODOLOGY.md`: there is no warm-up, no exercise, no hint ladder, no re-test and no
real-world detour.

Two rules from `core/METHODOLOGY.md` still apply: its *Delivery* section, and bridging from
`state/LEARNER.md` instead of re-teaching what the learner already knows.

A scratched topic is **not** a completed topic. It was seen once and quizzed once, never practised.

## 1. Pick the batch

The scope is whatever follows `scratch` in the argument, resolved inside the active track.

| Scope | Batch |
|---|---|
| a curriculum section heading or its theme (`Track B`, `collections`) | that section's rows |
| topic IDs or a range (`07 09`, `08-10`) | those rows |
| *(none)* | the next uncompleted rows, in the bootstrap's "next topic" order |

- The unit is a curriculum **row**, not the lettered sub-lessons a full lesson splits it into.
- A batch is **3–6 rows**. A larger scope is cut into batches: say so, name the batches, do the
  first.
- Skip rows already under **Completed** unless the learner named them.
- Order inside the batch: rows marked ★ and rows with an open `state/SOURCES.md` row go first.

Open with one line naming the batch, then teach. Do not ask for confirmation.

## 2. Teach — the whole batch in one turn

One headed block per topic, about 120 words plus one view. Do not wait between blocks and ask
nothing inside them.

| Part | Size |
|---|---|
| Mental model | one sentence |
| Minimal snippet | the smallest code that shows it |
| Classic trap | the line that looks right and is not, and what it really does |
| Interview answer (30 s) | 2–3 sentences, the passing version |
| Source | the row's *Read:* link where it has one, else the primary source by title |

**When a topic does not fit the block, cut in this order:**

1. Sub-topics that are neither marked ★ nor asked in an open `state/SOURCES.md` row — reduce each
   to one "also exists" line (`TreeMap`: sorted, O(log n)), or drop it.
2. History, version notes and rarely used API.
3. The snippet — shrink it to the one line that shows the trap.
4. The mental model's supporting detail, down to its single sentence.

Never cut the classic trap or the interview answer. If those two alone do not fit, the row is too
big for a scratch block: split it into two blocks and say so.

## 3. Quiz — one message, then wait

About one question per topic, **six at most**, numbered, each with its view. At least half are
predict-the-output or spot-the-bug; ask for the reason every time.

Answer with **one** verdict message. Each verdict repeats its question above the learner's answer
and the correct one. A wrong answer gets the correction in one or two lines and a named
misconception. No re-teach beyond that and no re-test: a miss is what a full lesson is for.

## 4. Close

- Write `<learning-home>/playground/scratch-<scope>/CHEATSHEET.md` and give the path: one entry of
  4–5 lines per topic (mental model, trap, interview answer), quiz misses marked.
- In `state/PROGRESS.md`, add each row to **Scratched** with today's date and its quiz result, and
  add each miss to **Weak spots to revisit** in that file's line format.
- Leave **Completed**, every **Current** line and `state/SOURCES.md` untouched.

Then offer the next batch, or a full lesson on the weakest topic. Start neither.
